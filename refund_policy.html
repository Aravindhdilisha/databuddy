Bids have no monetary value; are not credited against the purchase price of products purchased on the Site; and may not be exchanged for money or any items of monetary value.

        Due to the billing of charges, Databuddy would like to advise all users to monitor their bidding practices. Repeated online bidding can incur high costs. Users should therefore pay attention to their bidding practices.
